(BRMS) using the Rete algorithm. The gem allows you to manage your
business rules in a scalable and efficient manner.

## The name "Ruleur"

memorable, and easy to associate with the purpose of the gem. The "ru"
at the beginning of the name aligns with the naming convention for
Ruby gems, and the "leur" at the end gives the name a unique and

## Rete Algorithm Overview

The Rete algorithm is a rule-based system used to efficiently
match facts against a set of rules. Ruleur implements this
algorithm to provide a scalable and efficient way to manage
business rules. This section provides an overview of main
components and how they work together.

  - Nodes: Alpha and Beta
    - Alpha: Filter facts based on conditions
    - Beta: Match filtered facts to activate rules
- Rule Set: Top-level container for all rules
- Rules: Business rules with conditions and actions
- Facts: Data processed by the system
