# Contributing to Ruleur

Looking to contribute something to Ruleur? **Here's how you can help.**

## Key branches

- `main` is the latest, published version.

## Pull requests

- If your PR fixes bugs or documentation, pull against the `main` branch
- If your PR includes new features, pull against the `develop` branch
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
- **Test.** If you find a bug, write at first a failing test case and then fix it.
